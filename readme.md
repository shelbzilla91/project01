My project is a representation of my love for 70's/80's trivia. 

**The Set Up**

I had a lot of ideas of what I wanted to happen,I wanted to set it up in a grid layout and separate it by category. Under each category, there are five questions that are shown when clicked, and the it is shown as multiple choice.

When you click the corresponding box for the category the user chooses, a answer box will show on the right, and the user will choose the right or wrong answer from the multiple choice. 
If the user chooses the right answer, then the points in the scoreboard below will go up. If the user chooses the wrong answer, then the user will have the points go down based on the point value in the boxes.

**Thoughts on my plan/ What else I would Do**

If I had more time, I wanted to have the animation at the bottom show up when the user got it correct and show a gif image relative to the 80's.<br>
I also wanted to put corresponding music to go off whenever the answer was right on wrong, depending on the user's input.<br>
I also wanted to have a animation show in the scoreboard and maybe a 'cha-ching' sound when the score goes up too.

**Frameworks**
I wanted to try using bootsrap, but was strapped on time. I used Jquery, vanilla Javascript, and HTML/CSS for the style.
